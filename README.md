# AngularJS Unit Testing #

This document provides [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) unit testing examples. The samples are authored in Visual Studio (VS) 2013 and test angularjs and javascript code contained in an ASP.NET MVC project.

Tests are contained in a library project. The tests use Chutzpah as the test runner and Jasmine as the testing framework. Note that QUnit can be used instead of Jasmine.

#Required Software#

- VS 2012/2013
- [Chutzpah](http://chutzpah.codeplex.com/) - a javascript test runner that provides VS integration.
- [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) - a BDD-style framework for testing JavaScript code.
